## Overview 

This is our final Project for the "Python for Data Analysis" course. The goal for this project was to understand the implications of manipulating a data set, from data processing and data visualization to machine learning. With **Chlo√© Coursimault** we worked on the Drug Consumption Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

There are 1885 responders in the database. Twelve characteristics are known for each respondent: NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), as well as education, age, gender, country of residence, and ethnicity, are used to assess personality.

Participants were also asked about their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepines, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine, and volatile substance abuse) as well as one fictitious drug (Semeron) that was used to identify over-claimers.

They had to choose between 'Never Used,' 'Over a Decade Ago,' 'Last Decade,' 'Last Year,' 'Last Month,' 'Last Week,' and 'Last Day' for each drug.

## Key Topics üîç
  
To carry out the study of our dataset, we splitted our project into different points : 

  

* Dataset exploration & analysis
  * Drugs : proportions & representations
  * Demographic data 
  * Personality traits
* Data pre-processing
  * Biaised variables
  * Binary outputs
  * Data cleaning
* Machine Learning prediction
  * Logistic Regression
  * Linear SVC
  * Gaussian NB
  * Random Forest
  * Decision Tree
  * KNN
  * XGBOOST
  * SVM
  * Neural Network
* Conclusion
  * ML algorithms comparisons
  * Wich one is the best model ? ü•á

Throughout this study we wanted to reply to this question : *" Has the individual with the characteristics X used illegal drugs lately (up to one year)? "*.
In order to reply to this question, we splitted the drug consumption in two categories, if the drog was used up to last year, the individual is considered as an user, otherwise it's a non-user. Then we got rid of biaised variables such as *Country* and *Ethinicity* because they were composed on unevenly represented categories (80% of white from UK).
We performed multiples machine learning and found at that the most performant was : *Random forest & logistic regression*

This project is also available in an Application form through Django ! Don't hesitate to have a look :)
